# universeCalc
A shell calculator that can calculate anything you wish for. It is in development stage right now. It will be updated constantly because there are
so many formulas existing that it's hard to put them all in one app. You can exit it using the phrase "exit", "quit", "i ain't readin allat", "dancing. walking. rearranging furniture". The calculator is going to be installable on linux through a shell script or if you would like to do this manually just pull the executable to /usr/bin/ folder and you can use it in the shell without doing ./blahblahblah. On windows it should be runnable through the shell too. I'm not sure tho, I don't use windows.

**LEGAL STUFF**

I did not put any license on this project and not planning to. Just take the code, do anything the hell you want, publish it anywhere the hell you could wish to. I do not care. Just download the code and you can do anything you want with it. That's all.


**3 day development report. (13.02.2023 - 15.02.2023)**


The project is going well. I have met one issue that I fixed some time ago. I also decided the program to not loop forever because looping has also brought some issues. I have so far programmed:
sine,
cosine,
tangent,
adding,
subtracting,
multiplying,
dividing,
square area calc,
triangle area calc,
rectangle area calc,
rhombus area calc,
parallelogram area calc,
trapezoid area calc

There is also another issue, but I am going to keep it because I do not think it's fixable and I don't want to screw the project by fixing it. That issue should just stay. When you enter text when the program asks you for a number it puts 0 and a random number in. This is the issue.


**17.02.2023 The first official release**

Yes, today on 17th of February I am releasing the first version of the universeCalc. It can be installed on linux by running the sh script in the same directory the universeCalc file is in. Windows and Mac users are advised to SUCK IT.
