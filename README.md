# universeCalc
A shell calculator that can calculate anything you wish for. It is in development stage right now. It will be updated constantly because there are
so many formulas existing that it's hard to put them all in one app. You can exit it using the phrase "exit", "quit", "i ain't readin allat", "dancing. walking. rearranging furniture". The calculator is going to be installable on linux through a shell script or if you would like to do this manually just pull the executable to /usr/bin/ folder and you can use it in the shell without doing ./blahblahblah. On windows it should be runnable through the shell too. I'm not sure tho, I don't use windows.

**LEGAL STUFF**

I did not put any license on this project and not planning to. Just take the code, do anything the hell you want, publish it anywhere the hell you could wish to. I do not care. Just download the code and you can do anything you want with it. That's all.
